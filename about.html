                    I am in the Washington Air Force National Guard and have been since 2019.
                    Before I joined in 2019 I did two semesters at North Idaho College and then got 
                    sent into the long training process which meant I stepped away from school for a while.
                    I came back to school in the Fall of 2024 picking back up where I had left off, with some 
                    new faces among the Professors. I was deployed to Djibouti back in 2023 and can now rightfully
                    never recommend anyone to travel to Africa. I'm coming up on my reenlistment and with a new bonus
                    for my career field it seems likely that I will be reenlisting. In my offtime I play video games
                    and suffer through hot pilates with my friends.
